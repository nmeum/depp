* Fix padding of line numbers
* Specifically handle git submodules
* Consider rendering the README through external tools
	* E.g. markdown.pl, discount, â€¦
	* A git-readme-render file could be invoked on a per-repo basis
* Sort Tree entries by type
* Optionally include a short description in the header
	* For example, through a description file as used by gitweb
